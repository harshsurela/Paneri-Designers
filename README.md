This project was my final year endeavor, aimed at transforming the traditional brick-and-mortar store into a modern online shopping experience.

The goal of this project was to create a user-friendly and feature-rich Ecommerce platform that allows customers to browse, select, and purchase products conveniently from the comfort of their homes.
